\title{Kinship coefficients}
\usage{
ibd_kinship(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A pedigree, in the form of a \code{\link[pedtools:ped]{pedtools::ped}} object.}
}
\value{
A symmetric matrix containing all pairwise kinship coefficients in
\code{x}.
}
\description{
Compute the matrix of kinship coefficients of all members of a pedigree. The
founders may be inbred; see \code{\link[pedtools:founder_inbreeding]{pedtools::founder_inbreeding()}} for how to set
this up.
}
\details{
For two (possibly identical) members $A, B$ of a pedigree, their \emph{kinship
coefficient} is defined as the probability that random alleles sampled from
$A$ and $B$ at the same locus, are identical by descent relative to the
pedigree.
}
\examples{
# Kinship coefficients in a nuclear family with two children
x = nuclearPed(2)
ibd_kinship(x)

# Recaluclate if the father is 100\% inbred
founder_inbreeding(x, 1) = 1
ibd_kinship(x)
