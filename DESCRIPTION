Description: Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness coefficients, 
    including pairwise kinship, kappa and identity coefficients. Both autosomal 
    and X-linked coefficients are computed. Founders are allowed to be inbred. 
    More specialised coefficients include generalised kinship coefficients and 
    two-locus identity coefficients. This package is part of the 'ped-suite' 
    collection of packages for pedigree analysis, with 'pedtools' as the core 
    package for creating and handling pedigree objects.
